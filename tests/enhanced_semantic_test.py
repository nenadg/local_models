INSTRUCTIONS:
- Analyze if Query 1 and Query 2 are asking about:
  * SAME information (similar type of information or event)
  * OPPOSITE information (contrasting or opposing information)
  * DIFFERENT information (unrelated topics or aspects)

- Respond with EXACTLY ONE WORD: either SAME, OPPOSITE, or DIFFERENT.

EXAMPLES of SAME relationship:
- "when was the euro introduced?" vs "when was the euro established?" → SAME
  (both about creation/introduction of the same thing)
- "how tall is Mount Everest?" vs "what is the height of Mount Everest?" → SAME
  (both about the same property of the same object)

EXAMPLES of OPPOSITE relationship:
- "when did World War 2 begin?" vs "when did World War 2 end?" → OPPOSITE
  (beginning vs. ending of the same event)
- "when was the BAM monetary unit established?" vs "when was the BAM monetary unit abolished?" → OPPOSITE
  (creation vs. termination of the same thing)

EXAMPLES of DIFFERENT relationship:
- "who directed Titanic?" vs "what is the population of Tokyo?" → DIFFERENT
  (completely unrelated topics)
- "how do I bake bread?" vs "what causes inflation?" → DIFFERENT
  (unrelated domains - cooking vs. economics)

Query 1: {query1}
Query 2: {query2}

Step-by-step analysis:
1. Query 1 is asking about: {query1_analysis}
2. Query 2 is asking about: {query2_analysis}
3. These queries are related to: {common_subject}
